Version Creation Logic:

Major version increments (v1.0 → v2.0) for significant changes
Minor version increments (v1.0 → v1.1) for refinements
Branched versions use notation like "v2.0-alternative"
All versions retain parent references for tree visualization


Version Comparison Implementation:

Differential comparison showing added/removed/modified content
Section-by-section comparison with visual highlighting
Metrics comparison showing quality improvements
