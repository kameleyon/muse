**Last Updated: April 3, 2025**

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to MagicMuse ("we," "our," or "us"). This Cookies Policy explains how MagicMuse uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website and application at [www.magicmuse.io](http://www.magicmuse.io) ("Platform"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

This Cookies Policy should be read together with our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. By using our Platform, you are agreeing to the use of cookies as described in this policy.

## 2. What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, MagicMuse) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your device both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

## 3. Why Do We Use Cookies?

We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Platform to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Platform and provide personalized content and features. Third parties serve cookies through our Platform for analytics, personalization, and marketing purposes.

## 7. Do Not Track Signals

Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that signals to websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Given that there is not a uniform standard for "Do Not Track" signals, our Platform does not currently respond to "Do Not Track" signals. However, you can manage your preferences regarding tracking activity in the section titled "How Can You Control Cookies?" above.

## 8. Data Retention

Different cookies have different retention periods. The typical retention periods for cookies we use are:

1. **Session Cookies**: These are temporary and expire once you close your browser.
2. **Persistent Cookies**: These remain on your device until you erase them or they expire. Expiration periods range from hours to years depending on the cookie's purpose.

The specific retention period for each cookie is detailed in the tables provided in Section 4 of this Policy.

Information that we collect may be transferred, stored, and processed in any country where we have operations or where we engage service providers.

We ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your personal data when transferred internationally, in compliance with applicable data protection laws.

Our Platform is not directed at individuals under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16.
