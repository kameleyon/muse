# Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

This document summarizes the security vulnerabilities that have been fixed in the MagicMuse application.

## 1. Vite Raw Query Parameter Vulnerability

**Vulnerability**: Vite's `server.fs.deny` configuration could be bypassed when using the `?raw` query parameter, allowing attackers to access sensitive files.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Updated the Vite configuration with strict file system access controls
- Added a custom security plugin to handle raw query parameter security
- Added middleware to enforce deny restrictions for raw requests
- Implemented case-insensitive patterns to prevent Windows-specific bypasses
- Added detailed documentation in `docs/SECURITY-FIX.md`

## 2. esbuild CORS Vulnerability

**Vulnerability**: esbuild allowed any website to send requests to the development server and read the responses due to default CORS settings (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`).

**Fix Implemented**:
- Updated esbuild to version 0.25.0 which contains security fixes
- Added a custom CORS security middleware in `src/utils/security-middleware.js`
- Modified Vite configuration to use secure CORS settings
- Created a security patch script to ensure CORS protection
- Added a `.npmrc` file to enforce secure esbuild version
- Created a CORS test tool to verify the security fix
- Added detailed documentation in `docs/ESBUILD-SECURITY.md`

## Testing The Security Fixes

### Vite Raw Query Vulnerability Test

To verify that the security fix for the Vite raw query vulnerability is working:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Attempt to access a sensitive file with the raw query parameter:
   ```
   curl "http://localhost:3000/.env?raw"
   ```
3. Verify that the request is blocked with a 403 status code

### esbuild CORS Vulnerability Test

To verify that the security fix for the esbuild CORS vulnerability is working:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open the `cors-test.html` file in a different browser or domain
3. Click on the "Run Test" buttons to verify that CORS protection is working
4. A successful test will show the requests being blocked by CORS

## Maintenance Recommendations

1. **Regular Updates**: Continue to update dependencies, especially security-related packages
2. **Security Reviews**: Periodically review security configurations, especially when adding new dependencies
3. **Development Practices**: Never expose development servers to public networks
4. **Environment Separation**: Use different configurations for development, staging, and production
5. **Security Monitoring**: Implement tools like Dependabot to automatically alert about security vulnerabilities
