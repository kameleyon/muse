MagicMuse Build Error Fix Report
Date: March 27, 2025

Issue:
The build was failing due to errors in the src/types/supabase.ts file. The TypeScript compiler was reporting unexpected keyword or identifier errors, suggesting the file had encoding issues.

Error messages:
- src/types/supabase.ts(1,1): error TS1434: Unexpected keyword or identifier.
- src/types/supabase.ts(1,6): error TS1434: Unexpected keyword or identifier.
- And multiple similar errors...

Solution:
1. Identified that the supabase.ts file had encoding issues
2. Created a new file with the correct content and proper UTF-8 encoding
3. Replaced the corrupted file with the properly encoded one

Fixed Implementation:
The supabase.ts file now correctly defines the TypeScript types for the Supabase database tables, with proper imports and exports:

```typescript
import { Database } from '../database.types';

export type Tables = Database['public']['Tables'];
export type TablesInsert = {
  [TableName in keyof Tables]: Tables[TableName]['Insert'];
};
export type TablesUpdate = {
  [TableName in keyof Tables]: Tables[TableName]['Update'];
};
export type TablesRow = {
  [TableName in keyof Tables]: Tables[TableName]['Row'];
};
```

Result:
The build now completes successfully, generating all the necessary files in the dist directory. The application should now deploy properly.

Note:
The supabase_types_temp.ts file in the root directory appears to be a terminal output file and not a valid TypeScript file. It should not be used as a reference.
