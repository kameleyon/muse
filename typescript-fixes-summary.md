# TypeScript Issues Fixed

## Overview
Several TypeScript errors were fixed in the MagicMuse application. These errors were related to missing exports and improper types in the OpenRouter service.

## Changes Made

1. Added missing model interfaces and data structures to the OpenRouter service:
   - Added `AIModel` interface
   - Added `availableModels` array with model definitions
   - Added `ContentPreset` interface
   - Added `contentPresets` array with preset templates
   - Added `GenerateContentOptions` interface for content generation

2. Fixed imports in components:
   - Updated `ModelSelector.tsx` to use the `availableModels` export
   - Updated `PresetSelector.tsx` to use the `contentPresets` export
   - Fixed `ResearchPanel.tsx` to properly import and use both the default export and named exports

3. Fixed type issues:
   - Added proper typing for parameters in callback functions
   - Ensured all async functions return the correct Promise types
   - Fixed an issue with a special character in a string that was causing syntax errors

4. Added proper service implementation:
   - Implemented a mock progress tracking system for research queries
   - Added utility functions for getting available models
   - Created a proper default export for the service

## Testing
- The TypeScript compiler now runs without errors
- The application builds successfully with `npm run build`

## Next Steps
- Additional testing is recommended to ensure all components work as expected
- Consider adding proper error handling for API requests
- Improve the mock implementations for better development experience

## Note
Some warnings about the .env file may appear during build, but these are not related to the TypeScript fixes and do not affect the application functionality.
