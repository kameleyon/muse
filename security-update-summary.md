### 1. esbuild Security Vulnerability
- **Vulnerability**: esbuild <= 0.24.2 allows any website to send requests to the development server and read the response due to default CORS settings
- **CVE**: Not specified in the Dependabot alert
- **Severity**: Medium

#### Actions Taken
1. Added esbuild v0.25.0 as a direct devDependency in package.json
2. Ran `npm install` to update packages 
3. Updated Vite to v6.2.3 to ensure the transitive dependency also uses the patched version
4. Verified that all vulnerabilities were resolved

#### Technical Details
- The vulnerability was in the development server, which sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header to all requests
